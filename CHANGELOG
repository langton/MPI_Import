	* MPI_Import.py: Fixed a bug (reported and diagnosed by Matthew Turk)
	that prevented unittest from importing correctly under Python 2.7.
	This was a consequence of relative imports not being handled
	correctly.
	* testMPI_Import1.py: New
	* trivialmod.py: New

	* MPI_Import.py: Initial public release. Testing was done on
	Python 2.6. There's been a report of an incompatibility with
	Python 2.7; I should have a fix available soon.
