	* cached_import.py: Added an alternate finder called simple_finder
	that caches only the directory contents, not the locations of all
	available modules. This appears to be comparable in speed to the
	MPI-enabled versions of the other finder.
	* tests/testOrder3.py: New; tests simple_finder.
	* tests/testNumPy3.py: New; tests simple_finder.

	* cached_import.py: Split mpi_finder into mpi4py_finder and
	pympi_finder.

2012-03-09  Asher Langton  <langton2@llnl.gov>

	* cached_import.py: Removed the redundant isdir() checks in
	_build_cache and find_module. Also fixed a bug related to
	rebuilding the cache when sys.path is modified beyond a simple
	prepend or append.

2012-03-09  Asher Langton  <langton2@llnl.gov>

	* cached_import.py: Added a constructor parameter skip_checks,
	True by default, to skip the extra os.access check.
	* tests/testOrder*.py: Duplicated test, with and without skip_checks
	* tests/testNumPy*.py: Test that we can import NumPy, with and
	without skip_checks.

	* tests/testOrder.py: Reorganized so the test indicates whether it
	passed or failed.
	* tests/: Added a few more error messages in 'wrong' modules

2012-03-08  Asher Langton  <langton2@llnl.gov>

	* cached_import.py: Typo prevented process_files from being called
	when prepend=False. This caused some modules to fall back to the
	default loader.
	* tests/testOrder.py: We now print out the loader used to load a
	module, to catch errors like the one above.

2012-03-08  Asher Langton  <langton2@llnl.gov>

	* cached_import.py: Fixed an ordering issue with prepended
	directories
	* tests/: New directory. Relocated one existing test, added
	a (skeleton of a) sanity check for cached_import.py.

2012-03-08  Asher Langton  <langton2@llnl.gov>

	* cached_import.py: Preliminary version. This is intended to
	replace MPI_Import.py, but it has not been thoroughly tested yet.

2012-01-18  Asher Langton  <langton2@llnl.gov>

	* MPI_Import.py: Fixed a bug (reported and diagnosed by Matthew Turk)
	that prevented unittest from importing correctly under Python 2.7.
	This was a consequence of relative imports not being handled
	correctly.
	* testMPI_Import1.py: New
	* trivialmod.py: New

2012-01-13  Asher Langton  <langton2@llnl.gov>

	* MPI_Import.py: Initial public release. Testing was done on
	Python 2.6. There's been a report of an incompatibility with
	Python 2.7; I should have a fix available soon.
