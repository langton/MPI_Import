	* cached_import.py: Typo prevented process_files from being called
	in when prepend=False. This caused some modules to fall back to
	the default loader.
	* tests/testOrder.py: We now print out the loader used to load a
	module, to catch errors like the one above.

	* cached_import.py: Fixed an ordering issue with prepended
	directories
	* tests/: New directory. Relocated one existing test, added
	a (skeleton of a) sanity check for cached_import.py.

	* cached_import.py: Preliminary version. This is intended to
	replace MPI_Import.py, but it has not been thoroughly tested yet.

	* MPI_Import.py: Fixed a bug (reported and diagnosed by Matthew Turk)
	that prevented unittest from importing correctly under Python 2.7.
	This was a consequence of relative imports not being handled
	correctly.
	* testMPI_Import1.py: New
	* trivialmod.py: New

	* MPI_Import.py: Initial public release. Testing was done on
	Python 2.6. There's been a report of an incompatibility with
	Python 2.7; I should have a fix available soon.
